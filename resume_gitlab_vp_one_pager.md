EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Senior technology executive with 23+ years leading enterprise-scale engineering across financial services, wealth management, consumer lending, e-commerce, and digital health.
- Built and scaled distributed orgs of 45–110+ engineers with full budget ownership ($3M–$5M), aligning architecture and execution to measurable business outcomes.
- Deep experience modernizing architectures (monolith → service-oriented), raising quality and reliability, and improving delivery throughput via DevSecOps automation and AI-enabled workflows (including agentic automation and Claude Code/GitLab Duo-class assistants).

SIGNATURE STRENGTHS (FIT FOR GITLAB ELT PILLAR)
- Horizontal execution & engineering excellence: standards, governance, reusable primitives, and embedded “tiger teams” that unblock verticals.
- Architecture modernization: domain decomposition, API/platform primitives, event-driven patterns, and cloud-native scalability for enterprise customers.
- World-scale operations: SLO-driven reliability, observability, incident learning loops, and compliance-first delivery in regulated environments.
- AI-assisted productivity: applied AI/automation to reduce non-creative work (workflow automation, decisioning, support ops) and accelerate teams; experienced operationalizing LLM-assisted development workflows for faster refactoring and review cycles.
- Cost & COGS discipline: cloud and vendor optimization without compromising availability or security.
